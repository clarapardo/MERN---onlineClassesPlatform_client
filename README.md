## DB filter/search engine
### React.js + MongoDB (Express)

This project was done with the aim of **deepen in MongoDB queries**, with multiple variables for searching within the data base.
<br>
The theme is a yoga website where multiple classes are being display. The user can directly search the class through the search-bar, or can filter the classes by goal, level, duration, style and/or intensity, as well as sort them by recommended, length, newest or alphabetically.

Developing this thematic with a **no-SQL DB** made sense because: 
<br>
a) This theme required a lot of data reading, yet not much data manipulation (CRUDs), so a non-related & document based DB was a perfect match
<br>
b) The data is not relataded :)

<br>

**TECHNOLOGIES**
<br>
The *frameworks*, *libraries*, and other tools used:
